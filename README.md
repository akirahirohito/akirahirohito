## Hello, world!
 
My name is Akira Hirohito and I am a Researcher and Software Engineer and Data Scientist currently based out in Montreal, QC. I am interested in physics, astrophysics, geophysics, and computer science as academic subjects, and would like to apply artificial intelligence / machine learning / algorithm to such studies, whether it is related to work or for my private interests. I am also fascinated by data visualisation, especially in the exploratory analysis performed on data cubes of many dimensions.

In my spare time, I contribute to the ecosystems of open-source software, predominately via SunPy (working on mostly the sunpy core and glue-solar project at the moment). SunPy member. 

In my spare time I enjoy kendo, field hockey, cricket, baseball/softball, gaming development, history, public radio (CBC, BBC, NPR), as well as current affairs.

## Writing and Blogging

I maintain a blog at [Medium](https://medium.com/@krisastern), which I have been using chiefly for satisfying Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019 & 2020 requirements, as well as for et cetera. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
